# Ganyu-s-Damage-Optimization-in-Genshin-Impact-A-Comparison-of-Iterative-and-Recursive-Approaches
The project explores the algorithm complexity of optimizing Ganyu's damage output in Genshin Impact, with a focus on comparing two engagement plans, which are the iterative and recursive approaches.

The aim of the project is to assess the time complexity of each method in optimizing Ganyu's damage output calculations based on key variables (mechanics) on the game Genshin Impact: artifact selection (Main and Substats, encompassing Crit Dmg and Crit Rate Percentage, Atk and Atk Percentage, Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge, Hp and Hp Percentage, Def and Def Percentage, and Dmg Bonus Percentage), Weapon Effects (Passive and Main and Sub Stats, also Weapon Refinement), constellation boosts (from first to sixth constellation), artifact set effects, and in-game mechanics, such as elemental reactions. The algorithms themselves will output the best utilization (from the aforementioned calculation) of the variables for the maximum damage output.
